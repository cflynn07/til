# TIL
> Today I Learned

A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
repository after reading Simon Wilson's [Hacker News post][1], and he was
apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2].

I made a reusable Github Action [til-auto-format-readme][3] that automatically
scans this repository's TIL *.md files generates this README.
